# Riemann
A program that approximates the definite integral of a relation using Riemann Sum approximations.

## Usage
The input to the program is provided in the file `c.in` and requires three lines of input. It should be structured in the format:

```
<NUM OF POINTS> <TYPE>
<x1> <y1>
<x2> <y2>
...
<xN> <yN>
```

## Types of Approximations
- `left-riemann` - Left Riemann Sum
- `right-riemann` - Right Riemann Sum
- `trapezoidal` - Trapezoidal Rule

Ensure `c.in` contains the appropriate input before execution. The output will be written to console.
